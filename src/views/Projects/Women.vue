        After the success of my 24 days of Javascriptmas challenge the preceding year, I wanted to tackle a new
        challenge. As women students in STEM fields often suffer from underrepresentafion in the industry, I wanted to
        showcase 24 at once, from various backgrounds, ages, ethnicities, and nationalities.

        I organized, filmed and edited 24 interviews with women in STEM I contacted through various ways, Linkedin, Instagram, Ladies of code and personal relations. Most of them where working in the CompSci field but also ranging from
        Mechanical engineering to Astrophysics.

        This was a great experience that taught me that STEM suffers from a lot of stigma that scares girls wanting to
        go into it, but this shouldnâ€™t be an obstacle and more motivation for us to see opportunity in our rareness.

        The most difficult part was project management, scheduling meetings with women accross the globe and setting up
        a good sound and video quality. It gave me a lot of confidence and drive to share my love for tech with as many
        diverse people as possible
