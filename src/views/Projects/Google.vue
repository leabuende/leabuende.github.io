        Collaborating in a team of 6, we had 3 days to come up with an innovative solution using the Cloud to fight
        climate change.

        We spend 2 days getting coached at the Parisian google headquarters by Thales and Google consultants. We came up
        with Greenmile, a mobile app to track your daily carbon footprint using data already available to us using
        googleâ€™s collected data, and complementary manually inputs.

      I then got to pitch our project to more than 300 people, and partake in the annual Google night !

      <h2>What did I learn ?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        I learnt how to quickly come up with an innovative idea as a group, but also about the different innovative
        applications for the Cloud. I would 100% recommend hackathons (And the Google night of course)!
