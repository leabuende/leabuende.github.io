          When I started off my journey to becomming a programmer, I got really
          intimidated by my classmates I was looking up to. However, I never
          pictured myself as a developer because I didn't have any role models
          that I could really relate to.

          Then, I found <strong>Ladies of Code</strong>. A community of passionate
          and talented women in STEM, devoted to inspiring students like myself to
          persue carreers in Computer Engineering.

          The most scary part of it all : creating original developer memes, while
          just starting of my developer learning journey myself !

          However I found that the intensive hours of developer memes on Reddit
          taught me more than some courses of my

        <p>
          Making <strong>memes</strong> on relateable subjects for developers
          taught me how to stay up to date on relevant tech subjects, and also how
          to engage in a team of developers. (Feel free to send me developer memes
          on <a href="" class="links animated-links">Twitter</a>)
