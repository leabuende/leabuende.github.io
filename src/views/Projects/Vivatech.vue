        Participating in Vivatechs Hackathon was easily one of the most exciting and interesting experiences of my life
        !
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For two weeks, my friend and classmate Duc-Thomas and I worked on developing a solution to the problem ‚ÄúThe
        future of urban mobility‚Äù where the challenge was to limit the use of personal cars in cities.
