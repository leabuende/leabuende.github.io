        December 2020, I set myself up to a new challenge: creating an advent
        calendar of videos solving small problems in JavaScript, explaining my
        solutions and posting them on Instagram. üë©‚Äçüíª
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My goal: encouraging anyone to get into programming. The challenge:
        finding the right words to explain each function, showing my mistakes
        and most importantly getting across that spending time correcting them
        is by far the fun part of coding.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The outcome: I receive messages from baby developers ready to start
        their coding journey every single day ü¶æ

      <h2>What did I learn ?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        This project mostly taught me to be consistent. It took me 1 to 2 hours
        a day to film and edit each video, and I was really proud to not miss
        one single day ! ü•∞

        Furthermore, even though the exercices weren't complicated to solve in
        any way, it was a whole other story to explain the code in a simple way
        that would be <strong> understandable for non developers</strong>.
