I learned to be more rigorous when <strong>conceptualizing an application</strong>. Visualizing different users, how they might interact with eachother and with the application...\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And of course, I loved working with the boys on my team, this will stay a great memory in my mind ! ‚ù§Ô∏è\n    </p>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n  \n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"MonOrdo\",\n};\n</script>\n<style scoped></style>\n"]}]}
